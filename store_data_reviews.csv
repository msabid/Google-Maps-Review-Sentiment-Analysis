The popcorn chicken was freshly made, as I had to wait about 4 minutes.   Overall a good quick meal on the go.  The only thing I would have liked, was a few more napkins.",4,0.30000001192092896,1.899999976158142

The fries were soggier than a limp .... Carrot üçå. The saving grace was the Pepsi, thank God it wasn't made here.

If this is the accepted standard for KFC I can't trust any other franchise ever again. Goodbye KFC. Save what is left of your reputation and shut this down.",1,-0.30000001192092896,4.599999904632568

Crisp? Coating that you could pull off and enjoy by itself before eating the piece of chicken? Well it doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. Flat, thin, tasteless, soggy stuff now. It‚Äôs sad. Fries were ok. Gravy was 1/2 full. Medium coleslaw was in 2 small containers, so that‚Äôs the same I guess- that is good but not the bright green spicy stuff they used to make. Meh. The service was great tho.",2,-0.30000001192092896,4.699999809265137
ChIJT1mRDEus0kwRj6busiW3kUo,2023-11-17 21:04:18+00:00,Aivy Faye de Guzman-Bonabon,"Terrible experience about survey promotions.

I recently had a disappointing experience at the KFC Cataraqui Center. Despite my efforts to participate in their survey promotion and claim a free small popcorn chicken with any (take note: ANY) purchase of a fountain drink, the staff‚Äôs lack of awareness and unimpressive behavior left me frustrated.

Everytime I visited this branch and presented my survey receipt for the promised free small chicken popcorn, the staff seemed completely unaware of the promotion with their poker and blank face. Instead of a smooth and quick process, I was consistently kept waiting as the staff fumbled to understand the promo details. This only shows lack of awareness reflects poorly on the management‚Äôs communication with their staffs.

To add, when I inquired about the cost of their smallest fountain drink, I was told that it was $1.05. However, when I attempted to claim the free small popcorn with my drink purchase, I am charged around $3. The inconsistency between what the staff communicated and the actual charges is I think not fair. The receipt clearly states that a free chicken popcorn is available with any purchase of ANY fountain drink, but the staff insisted on charging me more. It‚Äôs just so disappointing. If the promotion is contingent on a specific drink purchase amount, this info should be clearly stated on the receipt to avoid confusion and frustration for customers. I hope that KFC management address these issues promptly. I rarely give Google reviews, but you know, this left me thoroughly dissatisfied.",1,-0.699999988079071,10.699999809265137
ChIJT1mRDEus0kwRj6busiW3kUo,2023-10-23 19:39:10+00:00,Vodka Toxic,"I found the price very high for just 10 chicken nuggets. The nuggets are very small, and KFC does not cook to order, they just grab them from a heated cabinet. Not very hot, not very crispy. They just taste like grease. I found a hair underneath all the nuggets. The 10-piece nuggets came up on the register and it said ""no dip cup"" underneath. I wondered ""Why am I not getting a dip for buying 10 nuggets?"". Well, the cashier threw a ""KFC Sauce"" into the bag. I had no idea what it was, she did not ask what dip I'd like. It's a gross looking puke-colored dijon honey mustard. Go to Popeyes.",1,-0.699999988079071,7.800000190734863

The chicken is not like the typical chicken, it wasn‚Äôt bad, but not what was expected. The restaurant itself was very clean, the bathrooms and tables were clean.

The chicken itself was very overcooked covered in grease and pretty much inedible. I would call and complain but most they're going to do is offer me a deal for the next time we go which is never because the food is over priced trash and i won't be going back.
